                <h2><strong>About Me</strong></h2>
                <p>Hi! I'm Ada, Countess of Lovelace and am an English mathematician and<br> 
                writer, chiefly known for my work on Charles Babbage's proposed mechanical<br>
                 general-purpose computer, the Analytical Engine.</p>
                <p>I am one of the first to recognize that machines have applications beyond<br> 
                pure calculation, and to have published the first algorithm intended to be<br>
                carried out by such a machine.</p>
                <p>In my free time I like to read about scientific developments, mathematics, and<br>
                computational mathematics. I also like to take my chances of winning big.</p>
                <p>Fun fact! I've been programing for
                    <span id="time-container"></span> seconds!
                </p>
